    <h1><strong>Rani of Jhansi</strong></h1>
    <p>Lakshmibai Newalkar, the Rani of Jhansi born Manikarnika Tambe; (19 November 1828 — 18 June 1858), was the <a href = "n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja">Maharani </a>consort of the princely state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhansi_State">Jhansi</a> in the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratha_Confederacy">Maratha Empire</a> from 1843 to 1853 by marriage to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangadhar_Rao">Maharaja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar</a>. She was one of the leading figures in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857">Indian Rebellion of 1857</a>, who became a national hero and symbol of resistance to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_rule_in_India">British rule in India</a> for Indian nationalists.</p>
    <p>Born into a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karhade_Brahmin">Karhada Brahmin</a>family in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi">Banares</a>, Lakshmibai married the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao, in 1842.

    <h3>History of Jhansi</h3>
    <p>Manikarnika was married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao Newalkar, in May 1842[3][18] and was afterward called Lakshmibai (or Laxmibai) in honor of the Hindu goddess Devi Lakshmi and according to the Maharashtrian tradition of women being given a new name after marriage. In September 1851, she gave birth to a boy, later named Damodar Rao, who died four months after birth due to a chronic illness. The Maharaja adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who was renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before the Maharaja died.[19] The adoption was in the presence of the British political officer who was given a letter from the Maharaja instructing that the child be treated with respect and that the government of Jhansi should be given to his widow for her lifetime.</p>
    <p>After the death of the Maharaja in November 1853, because Damodar Rao (born Anand Rao) was an adopted son, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao's claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories. When she was informed of this she cried out <em>"Main apni Jhansi nahi doongi"</em> (I shall not surrender my Jhansi). In March 1854, Rani Lakshmibai was given an annual pension of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to leave the palace and the fort.</p>
    <h4>The Revolt of 1857</h4>
    <hr>
    <b>Beginning of the Rebellion</b>
    <pre>On 10 May 1857, the Indian Rebellion started in Meerut. When news of the rebellion reached Jhansi, the Rani asked the British political officer, Captain Alexander Skene, for permission to raise a body of armed men for her protection; Skene agreed to this.[23] The city was relatively calm amid the regional unrest in the summer of 1857, but the Rani conducted a Haldi Kumkum ceremony with pomp in front of all the women of Jhansi to provide assurance to her subjects, and to convince them that the British were cowards and not to be afraid of them.[24][25]

        Until this point, Lakshmi Bai was reluctant to rebel against the British. In June 1857, rebels of the 12th Bengal Native Infantry seized the Star Fort of Jhansi, containing the treasure and magazine,[26] and after persuading the British to lay down their arms by promising them no harm, broke their word and massacred 40 to 60 European officers of the garrison along with their wives and children. The Rani's involvement in this massacre is still a subject of debate.[27][28] An army doctor, Thomas Lowe, wrote after the rebellion characterizing her as the "Jezebel of India ... the young rani upon whose head rested the blood of the slain".</pre>
    <p>Four days after the massacre the sepoys left <strong>Jhansi</strong>, having obtained a large sum of money from the Rani, and having threatened to blow up the palace where she lived. Following this, as the only source of authority in the city the Rani felt obliged to assume the administration and wrote to Major Erskine, commissioner of the Saugor division explaining the events which had led her to do so.[30] On 2 July, Erskine wrote in reply, requesting her to "manage the District for the British Government" until the arrival of a British Superintendent.[31] The Rani's forces defeated an attempt by the mutineers to assert the claim to the throne of a rival prince Sadashiv Rao (nephew of Maharaja Gangadhar Rao) who was captured and imprisoned.</p>
    <bold>There was then an invasion of Jhansi by the forces of Company allies Orchha and Datia; their intention however was to divide Jhansi between themselves. The Rani appealed to the British for aid but it was now believed by the governor-general that she was responsible for the massacre and no reply was received. She set up a foundry to cast cannon to be used on the walls of the fort and assembled forces including some from former feudatories of Jhansi and elements of the mutineers which were able to defeat the invaders in August 1857. Her intention at this time was still to hold Jhansi on behalf of the British.</bold>
    <strong>Flight to Gwalior</strong>
    <ol ="I">
        <li>The leaders (the Rani of Jhansi, Tatiya Tope, the Nawab of Banda, and Rao Sahib) fled once more. </li>
        <li>
    They came to Gwalior and joined the Indian forces who now held the city <i>(Maharaja Scindia having fled to Agra from the battlefield at Morar)</i>. </li>
        <li>They moved on to Gwalior intending to occupy the strategic Gwalior Fort and the rebel forces occupied the city without opposition.</br> The rebels proclaimed Nana Sahib as Peshwa of a revived Maratha dominion with Rao Sahib as his governor (ਸੂਬੇਦਾਰ) in Gwalior. </li>
        <li>The Rani was unsuccessful in trying to persuade the other rebel leaders to prepare to defend Gwalior against a British attack which she expected would come soon. General Rose's forces took Morar on 16 June and then made a successful attack on the city.</li>
        </ol>

    <h5>Death and aftermath</h5>
    <hr>
    <p>On 17 June in Kotah-ki-Serai near the Phool Bagh of Gwalior, a squadron of the 8th (King's Royal Irish) Hussars, under Captain Heneage, fought the large Indian force commanded by Rani Lakshmibai, who was trying to leave the area. The 8th Hussars charged into the Indian force, slaughtering 5,000 Indian soldiers, including any Indian "over the age of 16".[42] They took two guns and continued the charge right through the Phool Bagh encampment. In this engagement, according to an eyewitness account, Rani Lakshmibai put on a sowar's uniform and attacked one of the hussars; she was unhorsed and also wounded, probably by his saber. Shortly afterward, as she sat bleeding by the roadside, she recognized the soldier and fired at him with a pistol, whereupon he "dispatched the young lady with his carbine".[43][44] According to another tradition Rani Lakshmibai, the Queen of Jhansi, dressed as a cavalry leader, was badly wounded; not wishing the British to capture her body, she told a hermit to burn it. After her death, a few local people cremated her body.</p>
